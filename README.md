# PythonFiles

This repository contains Python files related to the Data Structures and Algorithms module.

## Files:

### 1. [`BinaryTree.py`](BinaryTree.py)

#### Description:
- Implements a binary search tree data structure (`Tree` class) along with methods to insert elements (`insert`) and search for elements (`find`).

#### Usage:
- The `Tree` class can be used to create and manipulate binary search trees.
- Example usage is demonstrated in the code.

### 2. [`Matrix.py`](Matrix.py)

#### Description:
- Implements a graph data structure (`Graph` class) using adjacency matrices.
- Includes methods for adding vertices (`add_vertex`), adding edges (`add_edge`), and printing the graph (`print_graph`).

#### Usage:
- The `Graph` class can be used to create and manipulate graphs.
- Example usage is demonstrated in the code.

### 3. [`Vertex.py`](Vertex.py)

#### Description:
- Implements a graph data structure (`Graph` class) using dictionaries to represent vertices and edges.
- Includes methods for adding vertices (`add_vertex`), adding edges (`add_edge`), and printing the graph (`print_graph`).

#### Usage:
- The `Graph` class can be used to create and manipulate graphs.
- Example usage is demonstrated in the code.

### 4. [`Leetcode75`](Leetcode75)

#### Description:
- Goes through python questions found in the Leetcode 75 Essential & Trending Problems

#### Usage:
- Learn and develop python problem solving skills that may come up in interviews or future projects.

### 4. [`IntroductionToPandas`](IntroductionToPandas)

#### Description:
- Explores fundamental concepts and functionalities of the Pandas library in Python.
- Covers essential techniques for data manipulation, analysis, and exploration using Pandas.

#### Usage:
- Gain foundational knowledge of Pandas for data handling tasks in data science, machine learning, and other data-related projects.
- Understand how to work with tabular data effectively, perform data cleaning, transformation, and analysis using Pandas.
