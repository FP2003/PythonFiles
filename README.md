PythonFiles

This repository contains Python files related to the Data Structures and Algorithms module.

Files:
1. BinaryTree.py
Description:
Implements a binary search tree data structure (Tree class) along with methods to insert elements (insert) and search for elements (find).
Usage:
The Tree class can be used to create and manipulate binary search trees.
Example usage is demonstrated in the code.
2. Matrix.py
Description:
Implements a graph data structure (Graph class) using adjacency matrices.
Includes methods for adding vertices (add_vertex), adding edges (add_edge), and printing the graph (print_graph).
Usage:
The Graph class can be used to create and manipulate graphs.
Example usage is demonstrated in the code.
3. Vertex.py
Description:
Implements a graph data structure (Graph class) using dictionaries to represent vertices and edges.
Includes methods for adding vertices (add_vertex), adding edges (add_edge), and printing the graph (print_graph).
Usage:
The Graph class can be used to create and manipulate graphs.
Example usage is demonstrated in the code.
